      <h3><a class="a-link" href="https://www.historianofthefuturex.com/">Historian of the Future </a></h3>
      <p>
        Historian of the Future is a website focused on tech and science. The website’s creator, Charles Ostman, is a physicist; dedicated to doing presentations and publications about strategic research, tech development, and evolution into the next
        millennium. To be honest, I could not look at the website for more than five minutes. The combination of colors and animations made me sick. I’m so confused with this website, and I have no idea who the target audience is.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Contrast - The contrast used on this website makes the text difficult to read, and the bright text color and background color choice clash. Additionally, the animations are distracting and make it difficult to focus on the content of the
          website.
        </li>
        <li>Repetition - The website is somewhat consistent with the font color and sizes. Although, the elements are not properly aligned.</li>
        <li>Alignment - The website layout lacks uniformity. Also, one webpage has a grid layout; another webpage has single or multiple columns content. Some pages have a center content whereas, the other pages are aligned to the left or right.</li>
        <li>Proximity - The website lacks a sense of organization and cohesion. It looks like the website designer threw in too much content on the webpage and hoped, the content would stick on the webpage.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />

      <h3><a class="a-link" href="https://slack.com">Slack</a></h3>
      <p>
        Slack is a business communication tool. Slack is a tool that targets businesses, but it can be used by anyone. The main feature is to simplify communication among team members. Slack is simple and easy to use, although many features could be
        added to the paid version.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contrast - The design elements are simple but effective. The emphasis is on the most crucial information; the color contrast makes the website stand out.</li>
        <li>Repetition - - The website alternates the content (text and images) between two columns. It has well-defined lines, fonts, and colors that guide the visitor through the different sections.</li>
        <li>Alignment - The elements are perfectly aligned to left and right with a good amount of space on the middle of the page, and plenty of white space.</li>
        <li>
          Proximity - The elements are grouped on rows of content with some alternation of an image on the left and text on the right or vice versa. Some other sections with more content are grouped with more elements on the same row, but with enough
          space in between.
        </li>
      </ul>
